However, this request does not pass the commentsPreventMultipleCalls check in the get_comments function. Therefore, you end up with an empty container for the comments, and not a call to fill that empty container with comments, and now the last of the multiple calls made during the scroll to the bottom is on its way back from the PHP page, carrying an empty array because you had arrived at the bottom and there were no more comments to retrieve. So now, in the callback function, the conditional that is supposed to add .emptyNowPlaceholder's evaluates to true, and therefore you end up with that .emptyNowPlaceholder instead of the comments you wished to saw when you clicked the see comments button, and you are confused as hell because just 2 seconds ago you saw like 20 comments. We have fixed this by setting the commentsPreventMultipleCalls to true before we make the request and after you click the see comments button, and aborting the last of the multiple requests made during the scroll to the bottom-most comments, this second step is optional, however if you don't do it, you will end up with a useless out-of-place .emptyNowPlaceholder lying beneath the comments you are to get from the call you made by clicking the see comments button.
